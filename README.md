## Introduction

# This repository uses the Paper Dashboard Angular template as a starting point.

The [Paper Dashboard Angular](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard-angular) is a Bootstrap Admin Template developed by [creative-tim](https://www.creative-tim.com/products) which combines soft colors with beautiful typography and spacious cards and graphics. It was built on top of Google's [Angular Framework](https://angular.io/) and the HTML version of [Paper Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-dashboard). It is a powerful dashboard but it is light and easy to be used. It has enough features to allow you to get the job done, but it is not crowded to the point where you can't find the files for a specific component.
Paper Dashboard Angular is built using the same design language as [Paper Kit](http://www.creative-tim.com/product/paper-kit), which you can use for the presentation pages of your website. You can easily use them together, or pick between them depending on the project you have.
